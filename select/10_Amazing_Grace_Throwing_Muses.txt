Amazing Grace
How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me

I was once lost
But now am found
Was blind but now I see

Tis Grace that taught
My heart to fear
And Grace my fears relieved

Now precious dear
That Grace appear
The hour I first believed

Through many dangers
Toils and snares
I have already come

Tis Grace has brought
Me safe this far
And Grace will lead me home

When we've been there
Ten thousand years
Bright shining as a sun

We've no less days
To sing God's praise
Than when we first begun

Amazing Grace
How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me

I was once lost
But now am found
Was blind but now I see
