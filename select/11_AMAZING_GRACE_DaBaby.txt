A nigga barely read the scripture, but I'm spiritual (let's go)
Seven figure nigga, thank you, God, it's a miracle (okay)
Turned on the lights and you see roaches in our cereal (what the fuck?)
You can't touch me now, we ain't the same, I still ain't feelin' you
Give a fuck about your feelings, pussy nigga, shit, I got feelings too (let's go)
Nigga, we was broke (how broke you was?) Shit, we had to steal our food
We cut like that, steal from us, shit, we rob niggas too
First time I ever robbed a plug, nigga, I was still in school (like seventeen)
I'll take your gun, trade yo' shit, come back with' a different tool (yeah)
I'on want that hoe, ain't coming back, bitch, I got a different boo (huh?)
Say I sound the same 'til my new shit dropped and they heard me switch the groove
I'on play both sides, you ain't one of mines, I don't like to pick and choose
A nigga barely read the scripture but I'm spiritual (let's go)
Seven figure nigga, thank you, God, it's a miracle (okay)
Turned on the lights and you see roaches in our cereal (what the fuck?)
You can't touch me now, we ain't the same, I still ain't feelin' you (ayy, pop yo' shit)
And no, I ain't feelin' these niggas, I'm numb
Before I blew up, did my shows with a gun
Still can go city to city alone with my jewelry on
This ain't what you want
Treat this bitch like a cold when it's cold outside (okay)
I got it on, it ain't in the trunk
Soon as I feel it's a threat, I'ma dump (bop, bop, bop)
You can play for the internet, you know what's up
Rock out a show and I leave with a slut (let's go)
So many bitches want a lil' nigga
Can't fit 'em inside of the truck
I ain't no beginner and this shit ain't luck
I don't like the library, but, nigga, I'm booked, yeah
Damn, he done got full of his self
Stick out his hand and it ain't gon' get shook
A bitch say my name and I don't even look
A nigga barely read the scripture but I'm spiritual (let's go)
Seven figure nigga, thank you, God, it's a miracle (okay)
Turned on the lights and you see roaches in our cereal (what the fuck?)
You can't touch me now, we ain't the same, I still ain't feelin' you
Bitch
