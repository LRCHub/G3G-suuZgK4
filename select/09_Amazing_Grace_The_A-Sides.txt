Sat there never yawning
Had to take all of the dawn in
Woke up just to have the light
Reflected from your eyes
"If this isn't nice, what is?"
She whispered softly to me
Wrote off shaking limbs
As just the cold against my skin
Couldn't understand the sweat
Collecting in my hands
"If this isn't nice, what is?"
She whispered softly to me
You take your time
You fill your space
With amazing grace
You move too quick for pictures
I won't blink 'cause I might miss you
You've got a halo floating round your head
While mine's exploding
"If this isn't nice, what is?"
She whispered softly to me
You take your time
You fill your space
With amazing grace
